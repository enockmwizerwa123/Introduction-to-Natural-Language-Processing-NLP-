# Introduction-to-Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-
NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP combines aspects of linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way.

The primary goal of NLP is to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding. It involves developing algorithms and models that can process and analyze large amounts of text data, extract relevant information, and derive insights from it. NLP techniques are used in various applications such as language translation, sentiment analysis, information extraction, text summarization, question answering systems, chatbots, and more.

NLP involves several fundamental tasks, including:

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw text data by removing noise, punctuation, and special characters, and converting text to a standardized format.

Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigning grammatical tags to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.

Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

Language Modeling: Building statistical models to predict the next word or phrase in a sentence, which enables tasks like text generation and auto-completion.

Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.

Text Summarization: Generating concise summaries of long documents or articles.
